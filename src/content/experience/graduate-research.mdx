summary: Investigated resilient distributed systems blending embeded, sofware, electronics, blockchain and post-quantum cryptography while building projects and colaborating with other students.
highlights:
  - Designed a post-quantum secured file transfer protocol with blockchain auditability for my master's thesis (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2504.07938v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv:2504.07938</a>).
  - Worked in embedded systems labs, colaborating with other students and professors on projects using FPGA, Micro Controllers, custom PCBs and 3D Printers.
  - Collaborated with cross-disciplinary teams exploring AI, quantum fundamentals, and trusted computing deployments.
stack:
  - Python
  - System Verilog
  - C C++
  - FPGA 
  - Linux
