- I live my values by building technology that serves people, not just markets. For me, innovation is only meaningful when it creates long-term value and expands human potential.  
- I push myself to balance ambition with responsibility, making decisions that prioritize ethics, and sustainability over short-term wins.  
- Collaboration is at the core of how I work, I believe that diverse perspectives and genuine partnerships are what turn bold ideas into real impact.  
- My values show up in how I lead, how I invest my energy, and how I measure success not by what I accumulate, but by the freedom and opportunity I help create for others.
