- My passion lies at the intersection of technology, impact, and human progress. I am not driven simply by innovation for its own sake, but by the belief that technology should have a positive impact. I am motivated to transform ideas into solutions that outlast trends and create long-term value. This fuels my entrepreneurial spirit, guiding me to pursue projects that are both ambitious and ethical.  
- I see technology as a bridge to freedom, and connectionâ€”not just technical progress. I thrive when I can align innovation with purpose, creating opportunities that inspire and empower others.  
- I am passionate about exploring emerging fields like blockchain, AI, and embedded systems, not only for their technical depth but for the new possibilities they open for society and business.  
- I like Sailing, windsurfing, and time on the water. These moments remind me of the balance between focus and flow, challenge and freedom.
