title: Custom RISC-V + CORDIC on FPGA
category: hardware
timeframe: "2023"
status: completed
summary: Designed a custom processor based on the open-source RISC-V architecture to create an interactive calculator with hardware-accelerated mathematical operations on the Basys 3 FPGA board.
stack:
  - RISC-V
  - FPGA
  - Verilog
  - High-level synthesis
  - UVM (Universal Verification Environment)
  - Basys 3 FPGA
impact:
  - Developed a fully functional calculator performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations with custom hardware acceleration.
  - Gained extensive experience in logic architecture design and decision-making within processor customization.
  - Implemented comprehensive verification using Universal Verification Environment (UVM) to ensure RTL performance met project specifications.
  - Successfully integrated custom firmware to drive peripherals including switches, push buttons, and 7-segment displays.
